# PacMan Factory
Primarily designed as a demonstration more than anything else, this *experiment* gives you an empty window where you can place yellow "munching" things and watch them bounce around the page
+ For simplicity purposes, these things will be referred to as "PacMans", after the arcade character with a fundamentally similar appearance

## Operating Instructions
+ The page starts empty, but you can add some by clicking pretty much anywhere on the page, besides the "Options" panel

+ You can also change the size and speed of newly-spawned PacMans using the sliders at the top-left corner
	> Only affects ones that are spawned afterwards; already-existing ones are unaffected by this
